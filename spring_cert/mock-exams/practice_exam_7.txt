Not correct:

@RequestMapping(value = "/getMyData") 
public @RequestBody MyDataDto getMyData() {

15. Which of these are true about declaring MVC controllers without using annotations? Select all that apply.

Create a controller class by implementing the Controller interface or extending any of Controller's implementations like AbstractController

A HandlerMapping implementation that does not use annotations can be used, to map the requests to the handler objects.

Not correct:

If bean A is a singleton, and it has a property bean B which is a non-singleton, every time bean A is acquired by a client, a new instance of bean B is always supplied.

To be able to do lookup method injection, the class that the Spring container will subclass, must not be 'final', but the method to be overridden can be 'final'.

Spring does not use CGLIB in the implementation of the lookup method injection feature.
