The /info endpoint in Spring Boot can be customized by configuring properties in the application.yml or application.properties file under the info.* namespace.


6) Which ones are true about scopes? Select all that apply. *
 A. For prototype-scoped beans, the client is responsible for cleaning up after the usage of the prototype bean. Spring doesnt keep further record of the mentioned bean after handing it to the client, unless bean post processors are added.
 B. The acquisition of a 'singleton' bean is more similar to calling a java 'new' operator, than the acquisition of a 'prototype' bean.
 C. The 'request', 'session', 'application', and 'servlet' scopes are only available in a web-aware ApplicationContext implementation.
 D. By default, when a singleton bean depends on a prototype bean, there will be an object instance of the prototype bean, and it is that same object instance that will be supplied to all users of the concerned singleton bean.


B. The acquisition of a 'singleton' bean is more similar to calling a Java 'new' operator than the acquisition of a 'prototype' bean.



D. By default, when a singleton bean depends on a prototype bean, there will be an object instance of the prototype bean, and it is that same object instance that will be supplied to all users of the concerned singleton bean.



7) Given the following integration test:
@RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class) @ContextConfiguration public class SimpleTest { //test methods here }
What can be said about the behavior of Spring when the test is executed ? (choose one) *
 A. Spring will look for a file named SimpleTest-context.xml in the same location as the SimpleTest class to use it to initialize the context
 B. Spring will not be able to create a test context for the tests to run in
 C. Spring will build an empty context and the tests will fail


A. Spring will look for a file named SimpleTest-context.xml in the same location as the SimpleTest class to use it to initialize the context

Explanation:

The @ContextConfiguration annotation without any parameters in this case indicates that Spring should look for a default XML configuration file based on the test class name (SimpleTest-context.xml) in the same location as the test class.

*
 A. There must be a bean named 'john' in the container.
 B. If the class have a property named 'age', and it is an 'int', it will be populated with the value 10.
 C. There must be a bean named 'project1' in the container.
 D. All of the above.


B. If the class has a property named 'age,' and it is an 'int,' it will be populated with the value 10.

Explanation:

The XML configuration is setting the 'age' property of the 'myBean' bean to the value 10.
Options A and C are incorrect as there is no requirement for beans named 'john' or 'project1' to be present in the container. The values "john" and "project1" are used as literal values for the properties, not as references to other beans.

 A. AOP
 B. JDBC
 C. OXM
 D. ORM


D. ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)

Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) provides advantages such as faster development, reduction of repetitive SQL code, and abstracting away vendor-specific SQL and database issues. However, it may require a slightly steeper learning curve, and for complex queries, it might be a bit slower compared to hand-written SQL queries.


24) What is used “under the hood” to implement the transactional behavior in Spring ? *
 A. JPA
 B. JDBC
 C. AOP


C. AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming)

Spring uses AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming) "under the hood" to implement transactional behavior. AOP allows Spring to separate transaction management concerns from the core business logic, enabling the application to apply transactions declaratively.

@Component
public class QuizBean {} 
package com.another.quiz;// autowiring the bean
@Component
public class AnotherQuizBean {      
@Autowired      
QuizBean quizBean;} 
*
 A. an exception will be thrown because there is no scope defined for the bean of type QuizBean
 B. a bean of type QuizBean is created and autowired into a bean of type AnotherQuizBean
 C. an exception will be thrown because @ComponentScan is missing from the configuration class so the bean definitions are not discovered


B. A bean of type QuizBean is created and autowired into a bean of type AnotherQuizBean.


The @Component annotation on QuizBean indicates that it should be automatically discovered and registered as a bean.
The @Autowired annotation on AnotherQuizBean's quizBean field signals Spring to inject a bean of type QuizBean into AnotherQuizBean when it is created.
Assuming the components are in the correct package scanning scope, the application should run without exceptions.
